//	Study the Twitter REST API docs to find which methods will provide the information you need to fill out the templates, based on the sample layout. The docs are linked in the project resources.


//	TODO:	Using Node and Express, request the data you need from Twitter’s API, render it in your template, and send it to the client at the “/” route.

/*	TODO:
Each rendered result must include all of the information seen in the sample layout:
*tweets -message content -# of retweets -# of likes -date tweeted
*friends -profile image -real name -screenname
*messages -message body -date the message was sent -time the message was sent
Note that you don’t have to display direct messages as a back and forth conversation. You only need to display the last 5 messages that were received, or the last 5 messages that were sent.*/

/*	TODO: Push Goals:
Add a section to the bottom of your page that allows a user to post a new tweet. The new tweet should display without having to refresh the page.
Add an error page to your application, so that if anything goes wrong with your routes, the user will see a friendly message rendered, instead of the default error code.
Include your personal background image from Twitter as a background for the page header.
